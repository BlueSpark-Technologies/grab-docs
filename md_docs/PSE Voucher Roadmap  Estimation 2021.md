# PSE Voucher Roadmap & Estimation 2021

In the next iteration we want the PSE Voucher Service to work again for Cyberport. (stand Sep 2020 it only works for Computer Universe).

As customers exploited the previous versions of the PSE voucher service (see here for detailsÂ PSE Project Lifecycle) we need some changes to be made in the legacy systems connected to the PSE Voucher Service. Therefore our Business Owner Ralph Andreeff created an official demand ticket https://devjira.cyberport.de/browse/CPDM2-3154 to change the Legacy Architecture in SAP / Cyberparts / Webshop. (If you don't have access communicate Dominik Eberlein please).

We wait until this is finished before we can reactivate and refurbish the PSE Voucher Core Service for Cyberport to use, so we don't need the prototype anymore.

Also for Cyberport we need to create the PSE Orchestration Service.

Non-Python Issue

Current solution

Target solution

business report:

* which vouchers are active?
* why were they calculated like that (source data)

which vouchers are active?

why were they calculated like that (source data)

Christian imports data from FTP server, creates report and exports csvs containing voucher data and Geizhals data. Runs automatically within a script on an ec2-instance.

Automated report or dashboard (Sumologic, extended report, export to S3 bucket).
