# Components - Current Architecture
## Pricing Service
The purpose of the Pricing Service is to collect all necessary data in order to calculate the best base price of a product for the tenantâ€™s webshop. This includes the price of a product, stock information, competitor data and various kinds of algorithm configuration. The algorithm configuration settings come from subscribing to certain topics on the E-commerce Cloud Service (ECS) and by calling respective API GET endpoint. Similarly competitor prices come from subscribing to a MPS topic on the Market Price Screening (MPS) and by again calling respective API GET endpoint. The third data source is the Data Integration Service (DIS), which provides all necessary Cyberport specific data.

After collecting this information it is parsed and used to calculate the optimal base price for a product. Certain price quality checks are also applied on this result and only if they are passed, it gets pushed to an SQS queue to be processed by SAP Pro and further distributed towards trailing external service until it finally appears on the webshop webpage itself.

## Pricing Service
The purpose of the Pricing Service is to collect all necessary data in order to calculate the best base price and also channel prices of a product. This includes the price of a product, stock information, competitor data and various kinds of algorithm configuration. The algorithm configuration settings and manual prices come from subscribing to certain topics on the E-commerce Cloud Service (ECS) and by calling respective API GET endpoint. Similarly competitor prices come from subscribing to a MPS topic on the Market Price Screening (MPS) and by again calling respective API GET endpoint. The third data source is the Data Integration Service (DIS), which provides all necessary Cyberport specific data.

After collecting this information it is parsed first base prices are calculated and some price quality checks are made. Only if they are passed, channel prices are updated. Once channel prices are there as well, both base price and channel prices get pushed to an SQS queue to be processed by SAP Pro and further distributed towards trailing external service until it finally appears on the webshop webpage itself. Therefore the Pricing Service (PS) covers only the back-end part of the price calculation.
