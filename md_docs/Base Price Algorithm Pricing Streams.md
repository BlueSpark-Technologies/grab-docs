# Base Price Algorithm: Pricing Streams

Currently there are 9 active streams, meaning price strategies or algorithms, to calculate the price of a product.

| Stream | Purpose | Confluence Page |
|---|---|---|
| B-Stock | Used products that are worth less than new products | Stream: B-Stock Pricing |
| Bundles | Bundle pricing (products containing of a group of subproducts) | Stream: Bundle Pricing |
| Unhealthy Inventory | Products that don’t get sold out quickly enough or are in stock for too long | Stream: Unhealthy Inventory Pricing |
| Merchant Based | Normal products that aren’t unhealthy or new, but have competitors | Stream: Merchant Based Pricing |
| No Merchants | Normal products that aren’t unhealthy or new, but don’t have any competitors | Stream: No Merchants Pricing |
| RRP Enforced | Products that should be priced via RRP no matter what | Stream: RRP Enforced Pricing |
| New Products | Products that don’t have competitors yet and are new and should be priced via RRP | Stream: New Products Pricing |
| Price Successor | Products that should have the same or a linked similar price to another product (e.g. blue vs black notebook) | Stream: Price Successor Pricing |
| Coverage Based Pricing | currently inactive | Stream: Coverage Based Pricing (CBP) |
| Reset Unhealthy Inventory | After an unhealthy product gets sold out, we reset the price to something larger in case we reactivate the product later | Stream: Reset Unhealthy Inventory Pricing |
| BTO (Build To Order) | Build to Order Products that are priced via internal costs + target markup | Stream: BTO Pricing |
